# Rate my desktop

## Contents


## Description

Rate-my-desktop is a website where users can post screenshots of their desktop and other users can rate them. It also contains a commenting functionality. 

As this is a final exercise of a [course](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SWD4TF021) at Haaga-Helia university of applied sciences, it has some restrictions on the technologies chosen. 

Project has to be done using Spring Boot and webpages have to be rendered using Thymeleaf. I think there is some freedom on database selection, but I am going for MariaDB. I will publish this service using Docker and I will use CI-tools from Github. 


## Wireframes

Since this is a backend-course, the frontend is kept quite simple.
